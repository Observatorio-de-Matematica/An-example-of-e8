# Digitalization of exceptional simple Lie algebras
(1)the digitalized 248 bases of 248 × 248 matrix of r8C by using Maxima’s function:matrix.
(2)Operations of the Cayley algebra and the Jordan algebra by using Maxima.
(3)Lie bracket operations of R4 , R6 , R7 , and R8 by using Maxima.
(4)Convertes from ad(R8C) over the Cayley algebra to the matrix of r8C over
complex numbers, by using Maxima for performing mathematical operation
and using the programming language Python for string conversion.
(5)Check the Lie bracket operations as matrix calculations of r4C , r6C , r7C , and r8C
and confirming these root systems.
(6)Decompose an element of r8C into a linear combination of the 248 bases matrices.
