(4)Select Evalute Cell(s) from Cell menu.  
2.3 Usage example
In case of R6C
   1st: Start wxMaxima
   2nd: Copy & paste 248_basis_matrices_load.mac
   3rd: Evalute Cell(s)
   4th: Copy & paste R6C_bracket_root_operation.mac
   5th: Evalute Cell(s)
Before executing r4C, r6C, r7C, r8C, and e8e7e6f4_compact, 
you must copy & paste and Evalute Cell(s) of 248_basis_matrices_load.mac. 
2.4 Remark
